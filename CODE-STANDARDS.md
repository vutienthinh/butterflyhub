Frontend Code Standards
=======================

## Overview
  - The objective of this document is to define the coding standard.
  - It is important to follow all the rules defined in this document.
  - Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.
  - Why code standards?
    - Consistency – like single person typed it.
    - Readability – easy to read the source code.
    - Maintainability – easy to modify the source code.
  - Technologies used:
    - [Jade](http://jade-lang.com)
    - [Less](http://lesscss.org)
    - [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
    - [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com)
    - [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
    - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

## Structure
  - Separation of content, presentation and behavior.
  - Indentation: two spaces should be used as the unit of indentation.

## Naming conventions
  - HTML:
    - Identifiers (names, ids and classes) contain only the characters [a-z0-9] and the hyphen (-).
    - Separate words in ID and CLASS names by a hyphen (-).
    - Avoid unnecessary long names.
    - Choose semantic names based on functionality, not on appearance or position.
  - CSS:
    - Avoid using ID selectors in CSS.
    - Use CLASS selectors:
      - Suffixes: -block, -list, -item, -form, -btn, -group for specific case
      - Prefixes: block-, list-, item-, form-, btn-, group- for general case
      - Prefixes for elements: select-, input-, textarea-, width-, color-, editor-
      - Block wrapper: outer, inner, content, group, wrap
      - General block naming: slideshow, slider, carousel, gallery,
  banner, accordion, calendar, datepicker
      - Common classes: wrapper, container, main, primary,
  secondary, sidebar, header, footer, overlay, nav, slogan, loading,
  thumb, preview, highlight, featured, related, panel, module, box,
  layer, tab, rating, caption, description, breadcrumb, paging, social,
  toolbar, toolbox, tooltip, active, inactive, current, focus, warning,
  error, success
      - Sprite classes: wi-general, wi-text, wi-icon, wi-button, wi-box, wilayer, wi-form, wi-form-elements, wi-corner, wi-frame
    - Avoid naming: id="id", name="name", class="class", name="submit", name="reset"
    - Abbreviation images:
      - Background: **bgd-**
      - Photo: **photo-**
      - Button: **btn-**
      - Logo: **logo-**
      - Icon: **icon-**
  - JavaScript:
    - Identifiers (variables, methods) contain only the characters [a-z0-9].
    - Capitalization:
      - functionNamesLikeThis
      - methodNamesLikeThis
      - variableNamesLikeThis
      - EnumNamesLikeThis
      - ClassNamesLikeThis
      - CONSTANTS_LIKE_THIS
    - Be descriptive

  - File naming:
    - The file name should be stored in and delivered as file-name.ext
    - Avoid naming a file with a period "."

  - Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.

## Jade
  - Jade is a terse language for writing HTML templates.
    - Produces HTML
    - Supports dynamic code
    - Supports reusability (DRY)

## HTML
  - Use **p** tags for paragraph delimiters instead of multiple **br** tags.
  - Use **div** tags to wrap labels and controls in a form.
  - Use **fieldset** tags to group related elements in a form.
  - Use **label** fields to label each form field, the for attribute should associate itself with the input field, so users can click the labels.
  - Use **h1** tag for page title, **h2** tags for block title, **h3-h6** tags for smaller heading in content.
  - The **form** element should has the same values of **name** and **id** property.
  - The **id** attribute must be unique within the document.
  - Do not use the **size** attribute on your input fields. Use CSS width instead.
  - Add comments on some closing tags to indicate what element you're closing.
  - Tables should not be used for page layout, they should be used for tabular
  data only.
  - Make use of **thead**, **tbody** and **th** tags (and **scope** attribute) when appropriate.
  - Use **microformats**, **microdata** when appropriate.
  - Do not use all caps or all lowercase titles in markup, use CSS **text-transform: uppercase/lowercase** instead.
  - The layer should be placed before closing of **body** tag. Prefer to get the content of layer from Ajax or generate from JavaScript.
  - Avoid to use **http** and **https** protocols in the same page, use // instead.
  - Use HTML encoded characters (&copy instead of ©).
  - Use HTML5 custom data attributes (data-).
  - Always use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes.
  - Nested elements should be indented once (two spaces).
  - Don't include a trailing slash in self-closing elements (HTML5 doctype).
  - Use attribute order: class, id, name, data-, src, for, type, href, title, alt, aria-, role.
  - Make sure all tags are nested properly.
  - Do not put a block element inside an inline element.
  - Do not nest a **p** tag in a heading **h1-h6** tag, and vice versa.
  - A link should have its **title** attribute.
  - An image should have its **alt** attribute.
  - A **form** tag should has its **action**, **method** attributes.
  - Some tags in pairs (ul – li, ol – li, dl – dt & dd).
  - Form elements (input, textarea, select) must have **name** attribute.

## Less
  - Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.

## CSS
  - CSS Sprites:
    - A sprite combines multiple images into a one large image and using CSS
background-position to only display parts of it.
    - This is a technique for making webpage faster because it reduces the
number of HTTP requests in the page.
    - Do sprite for all backgrounds, icons, bullets, buttons, special text fonts, custom form elements, frames, boxes, layers, etc.
    - Do not sprite for logos, particular images and photos.
    - Do not make sprites too large to avoid memory usage problem.
  - CSS Specificity:
    - Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied by the browsers.
    - If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins.
    - Using !important overrides all specificity no matter how high it is. Avoid using it if possible.
    - Understand cascading and selector specificity so you can write very terse and effective code.
  - CSS Values:
    - Colors:
      - All color values are written in the hexadecimal format and using
lowercase
    - Units:
      - Use pixel (px) unit – corresponds to actual pixels on the screen – for
margin, padding
      - Use em (em) unit – corresponds to the specified point size of the font – for text
      - Use percentage (%) unit for fluid width/height content
    - Fonts:
      - Always specify a fallback generic font
      - Font names with spaces must surrounded by double-quotes
  - CSS Shorthand:
    - CSS shorthand is preferred because of its terseness
    - Follow the TRBL acronym
    - Common shorthand properties: margin, padding, font, background, border, border-radius, transition, transform, list-style
  - CSS Box Model: Margin, Border, Padding, Content
  - Use a reset CSS file to avoid browser inconsistencies
  - Use a minimal number of style sheets
  - Properties should be listed in group similar:
    - Display & Flow (display, visibility, float, clear)
    - Positioning & Floats (position, top, right, bottom, left, z-index)
    - Dimensions (width, -width, height, -height, overflow)
    - Margins & Paddings (margin, padding)
    - Borders & Outline (border, outline)
    - Background (background)
    - Typography (font-, line-height, text-, -spacing, white-space, verticalalign, color, list-style)
    - Opacity & Cursors (opacity, cursor)
  - Avoid using !important if possible
  - Use the link tag to include, never use @import
  - Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g. input[type="text"]
  - Avoid specifying units for zero values
  - Avoid using style inline in the HTML file
  - Avoid using single line CSS because it can cause issues with version control
  - Single declarations on one line
  - Multiple declarations, one per line
  - Elements occur only once inside a document should use ID selector,
otherwise, use CLASS selector
  - Prefer CLASS selector than ID selector
  - Write selectors that are optimized for speed
  - For mobile version, should cut as separate images, do not use sprite images

## jQuery
  - site.js

    ```
    /**
     * @name Site
     * @description Global variables and functions
     * @version 1.0
     */

    var Site = (function($, window, undefined) {
      'use strict';

      var privateVar = null;
      var privateMethod = function() {
        // to do
      };

      return {
        publicVar: privateVar,
        publicMethod1: privateMethod
      };

    })(jQuery, window);

    jQuery(function() {
      Site.publicMethod1();
    });
    ```

  - l10n.js

    ```
    /**
     *  @name L10n
     *  @description Localization
     *  @version 1.0
     */
    var L10n = {
      group: {
        key: 'value'
      }
    };
    ```

  - plugin.js

    ```
    /**
     *  @name plugin
     *  @description description
     *  @version 1.0
     *  @options
     *    option
     *  @events
     *    event
     *  @methods
     *    init
     *    publicMethod
     *    destroy
     */
    ;(function($, window, undefined) {
      'use strict';

      var pluginName = 'plugin';
      var privateVar = null;
      var privateMethod = function(el, options) {
        // to do
      };

      function Plugin(element, options) {
        this.element = $(element);
        this.options = $.extend({}, $.fn[pluginName].defaults, this.element.data(), options);
        this.init();
      }

      Plugin.prototype = {
        init: function() {
          var that = this;
          this.vars = {
            key: 'value'
          };
          // initialize
          // add events
        },
        publicMethod: function(params) {
          // to do
          $.isFunction(this.options.onCallback) && this.options.onCallback();
          this.element.trigger('customEvent');
        },
        destroy: function() {
          // remove events
          // deinitialize
          $.removeData(this.element[0], pluginName);
        }
      };

      $.fn[pluginName] = function(options, params) {
        return this.each(function() {
          var instance = $.data(this, pluginName);
          if (!instance) {
            $.data(this, pluginName, new Plugin(this, options));
          } else if (instance[options]) {
            instance[options](params);
          }
        });
      };

      $.fn[pluginName].defaults = {
        key: 'value',
        onCallback: null
      };

      $(function() {
        $('[data-' + pluginName + ']').on('customEvent', function(){
          // to do
        });
        $('[data-' + pluginName + ']')[pluginName]({
          key: 'custom'
        });
      });

    }(jQuery, window));
    ```

## JavaScript
  - Indentation:
    - Avoid lines longer than 80 characters
    - When an expression will not fit on a single line, break it according to these general principles: break after a comma, break before an operator, align the new line with the beginning of the expression at the same level on the previous line.

      ```
      var result = 0,
        longName = '';

      var result = longExp1 + longExp2
                   - longExp3;

      var result = (longExp) ? longResult1
                             : longResult2;

      if((longCondition1 && longCondition2)
        || longCondition3){
        // Code here
      }
      ```

  - Comments:
    - Be generous with comments. It is useful to leave information that will be read at a later time by people (possibly yourself) who will need to understand what you have done
    - Make comments meaningful. Focus on what is not immediately visible
    - Comments should not be enclosed in large boxes drawn with asterisks or
  other characters
    - Comments should never include special characters such as form-feed and
  backspace
    - Multiline comments should be

      ```
      /*
      comment here
      */
      ```

    - Inline comments should be

      ```
      // comment here
      ```
  - Declarations:
    - One declaration per line is recommended since it encourages commenting

      ```
      var result = 0, // comment here
      longName1 = '',
      longName2 = '', longName3 = '';
      ```

    - Do not put different types on the same line
    - Try to initialize local variables where they're declared
    - No space between a method name and the parenthesis '()'

      ```
      function methodName(){
        // to do
      }
      ```

    - Open brace '{' appears at the end of the same line as the declaration
    statement

      ```
      function methodName(){
        // do to
      }
      ```

    - Closing brace '}' starts a line by itself indented to match its corresponding opening statement, except when it is a null statement the '}' should appear immediately after the '{'

      ```
      function methodName(){
        // to do
      }
      function empty(){}
      ```

    - Methods are separated by a blank line
    - JavaScript does not have block scope, so defining variables in blocks can confuse programmers who are experienced with other C family languages.
    - Put declarations only at the beginning of blocks
  - Statements:
    - Simple Statements:
      - Each line should contain at most one statement
    - Compound Statements: Compound statements are statements that contain
lists of statements enclosed in '{ }' (curly braces):
      - The '{' should be at the end of the line that begins the compound
statement
      - The '}' should begin a line and be indented to align with the beginning of the line containing the matching '{'
    - Conditional statements:
      - **if** statement

        ```
        if(condition1){
          // to do if condition1 is true
        }
        else if(condition2){
          // to do if condition2 is true
        }
        else{
          // to do if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
        }
        ```

      - **switch** statement

        ```
        switch(expression){
          case expression1:
            // to do 1
            break;
          case expression2:
            // to do 2
            break;
          default:
            // to do if expression is different from expression1 and expression2
        }
        ```

    - Loop statements
      - **for** statement

        ```
        for(initialization; condition; update){
          // to do
        }
        for(variable in object){
          // to do
        }
        ```

      - **while** statement

        ```
        while(condition){
          // to do
        }
        ```

      - **do** statement

        ```
        do{
          // to do
        }
        while(condition);
        ```

      - **try…catch** statement

        ```
        try{
          // to do
        }
        catch(e){
          // to do
        }
        finally{
          // to do
        }
        ```
  - White Space
    - Blank spaces should be used in the following circumstances:
      - A blank space should not be used between a function value and its '('
      - All binary operators except '.' (period), '(' (left parenthesis) and '[' (left bracket) should be separated from their operands by a space

        ```
        var result = longExp1 + longExp2;
        var result = (longExp1 + longExp2);
        var result = jsonData['result'];
        ```

      - No space should separate a unary operator and its operand except
when the operator is a word such as typeof

        ```
        var x = 0;
        x++
        --x;
        var y = -x;
        typeof x;
        ```

      - Each ';' (semicolon) in the control part of a for statement should be
followed with a space

        ```
        for(var i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++){
          // to do
        }
        ```

      - Whitespace should follow every ',' (comma)

        ```
        var x = 10, y = 15;
        function methodName(param1, param2, param3){
          // to do
        }
        ```

  - Global variables should be minimized
  - Variable declarations must start with **var** keyword
  - Variables and functions should be declared before used
  - Constants or configuration variables should be at the top of the file
  - JS expressions must end with a semi-colon
  - Don't rely on the user-agent string. Do proper feature detection
  - Don't use **document.write** function
  - Avoid using inline script in the HTML file
  - Avoid using **eval** function
  - All Boolean variables should start with "is", "has"
  - Create functions which can be generalized, take parameters, and return
values
  - Do not send too many function parameters
  - Minimizing repaints and reflows
  - Do not compare **x === true**, use **(x)** instead
  - Use **[value1, value2]** to create an array
  - Use **{member: value}** to create an object
  - Comment your code! It helps reduce time spent troubleshooting JavaScript
functions
  - End of file with a newline
  - Avoid:
    - Too much happening in a loop
    - Too much happening in a function
    - Too much recursion
    - Too much DOM interaction

## Grunt
  - The JavaScript Task Runner
  - Why use a task runner? In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it through a Gruntfile, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you and your team with basically zero effort.

## Node.js
  - Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
